Although I think focussing on the process is a great way of cancelling out procrastination, I was wondering whether it might contribute to loafing during your study session? After all, one is no longer concerned about finishing a product in a set time, instead they are focussed on spending a certain amount of time on studying. Is there not a danger that one would slow their learning pace down, after all, there is no focuss on finishing the product, and hereby increase difficulties with finishing the product?I would like to get some feedback on this matter in the hopes that we can all learn from this.Kind regards,Jules\n",

I made some setting at my browser so it deletes all the forms and log in data every time I close it, so basically I have to manually log in every time...trust me is annoying and I use it less also because of that.

I tried to apply this to other child elements but failed - the last item is always selected no matter how I play with the scroll.  I did the search on the google and the critical part is to add style=\"overflow-y:scroll; height: 800px;\" inside the <div> element that you want to spy on. Bootstrap documents also provide the explanation - Requires relative positioningNo matter the implementation method, scrollspy requires the use of position: relative; on the element you're spying on. In most cases this is the <body>. When scrollspying on elements other than the <body>, be sure to have a height set and overflow-y: scroll; applied.For more details, you may refer to  Hopefully it will be helpful to you all.  \n",

I would like to request that the Tasks include the fine grained details by which the assignment will be graded. Those details would be very helpful in making sure we have met the assignment criteria.Just a note: In the commercial world, (in my experience anyway), these extra requirements would be suitable cause for charging more to meet the new and improved requirements.

I am not a big fan of Peer Review but then again, if I were the teacher of a Coursera course with a ridiculous number of students, I would not be cheerful about grading all those files. So, a bad Peer Reviewer is also to be feared so, if someone does have a complaint about how someone reviewed their file, the TA is probably just going to look at the screenshot (since she or he probably doesn't have much more time than the professor), which is how I have decided to review the 3 files I receive (until informed otherwise). This is not a for-credit college class. All the students are assumed to be adults that want to learn so it's up to us to make sure our scripts work for our own sakes and our own benefit.

In either case, have you tried inserting rows  and using the bootstrap grid system to get the space you need ? That would be my first guess.  The other solution could be to enclose the panel in a div and apply percentage based space styling to the panel,  rather than pixel based  spacing.  That would avoid the pixel specs that you are trying to avoid.  (You can specify a html element to occupy certain percent of the parent element). Let me know if you try these out.\n",

If you get an unpleasant review, it causes you to get involved in some way.  Unfortunately, most educational systems focus more on the final grade than the knowledge gained.  My advice, forget about the grade.  If you are here for the grade, then you are in the wrong place!  No question is a stupid question!!     \n",

      "This is an old chestnut that I love to throw out there. Firstly because I'm pretty new to the whole Javscript/Bootstrap world and secondly because it's amusing to see how animated some people get about the topic.If I include my DOM manipulating code at the bottom of the body after all the other HTML then why do I need to use the $( document ).ready() block?My understanding is that using $( document ).ready() will cause the browser to wait until the document or DOM is loaded and ready before executing any code that is inside the ready() block. If you try to manipulate the DOM before it is ready then you may not get the effect you expect as the DOM elements may not exist yet.I've seen lots of instances where the DOM manipulating code is placed at the top just after the opening body tag. In this case it makes sense that you would use the $( document ).ready() technique.But if the DOM manipulating code is placed just before the closing body tag then the DOM must already be loaded (except for the closing body tag). Therefore why do I need the $( document ).ready() block.My guess is it's just good practice to always use $( document ).ready()There must be a few opinions out there on this topic.\n",

We are asked to produce code for which there has been no guidance.We have been shown some javascript in the first course but even then left largely on our own to figure it out.  Course 2 has been so much better until the final week were we have been asked to produce a code but have not had any exercises that support the requirement.My code is below, if anyone can point out on-line references that can help I would appreciate it.  I'm not sure why this does not work.HTML<!-- Button trigger modal -->\n",

It's true that the course didn't explain too much of JavaScript/jQuery part apart from carousel example, but the link to additional resources has all the info on this assignment. Anyway, if the modals worked for you before with data-* attributes, it will definitely work now as well :)\n",

      "\n",
      "The first grading was fair, it was an attention mistake and I resubmitted my fourth assignment. This time everything was fine. Surprise: the grade was unfair. I attach here the grading so you see for yourselves. Instead of giving me 5 points for \"The Login link has been given an id so that it can be referred to appropriately within the JavaScript code.\"  a peer, Thelemaque Dukens, gave me 0 points. The code for the login link exactly how it is in my submission: The id is there as you can see.Then , the same peer substracted 30 of my points at \"Correct JavaScript code has been added to the end of the page so that the Reserve Table modal is shown/hidden when the Reserve Table button is clicked.\".I wonder why. My code looks like this:The requirement was that the Reserve Table modal to be shown/hidden when the Reserve Table button was clicked. I chose to use \"toggle\" because this is exactly what toggle does: it shows/hides . What I did on top of the requirement was to add ids and \"hide\" behaviors for the \"close\" buttons  and the X-es too. I also removed the data-* from there.But this is on top of the requirements and I believe it has nothing to do with the grading.  I would really appreciate if Thelemaque Dukens told me what was the mistake in my javascript code that urged him to grade me 0 for that part of the code.\n",
      "Unfortunately, I have had the same experience just now. The code worked 100% correctly. The first grader gave me 100/100, while the second scored just 40/100 without any valid explanation. My guess is that he/she forgot to adjust the links to additional JS and CSS files as we did with Bower during the course and the scripts just didn't work for her/him...\n",
      "Yes, but at least they should have just looked at the code in the source , no? At least this is how I do it each and every time I grade someone.\n",
      "In fact, the person how has downgraded me looked at my code, but what he thought was a mistake was actually a correct way and worked just fine. Too bad we can we can fail so easily, because of one person's mistake in judgement.\n",
      "There should be a way to correct this.\n",
      "Agreed, although I think the only way now is to resubmit the assignment and hope for a quick review. Also, we have to start grading more people by ourselves.\n",
      "I am not resubmitting anything. The assignment was correct. I don't think this is normal. What if you find 2 peers that make this mistake :-)\n",
      "I thought that many peers might not have completed the bower tasks. So to be extra safe, I left a note in the submission section that it is assumed that the peer has completed the tasks mentioned in the lectures; if not, to replace the css and js sources with the usual ones. I know it still doesn't justify what happened to you, but just saying. \n",
      "Myself I have also included such a note to my submission that I'm using Bower and that links are changed, unfortunately it has not been read by the grader. In my resubmission of the assignment I have included both the Bower links as well as the common path that we used previously.\n",
      "I agree and I think it's ok , but if they grade as they should, they should look at the source code and then they will see the bower links anyway. \n",
      "[OFFTOPIC] Hi Iona, you shouldn't use 2 differents...All the javascript goes inside the same .ready() function.\n",
      "i think it should go inside the same .ready() function together with carousel handlers. so for homework it was only necessary to add  $(\"#reservetrigger\").click ..... and $(\"#logintrigger\").click ....and leave the others unchanged, maybe thats why they deducted points.I myself in some not 100% compliant solutions was upgrading to full score and leaving note what wasn't 100% right, but some people were downgrading. This is probably why you have 3 graders. I had to resubmit my first homework because of not passing the assignment. And I was really surprised because I though i would score 95%. But it taught me making my other 3 homeworks better presented with better indentation and clear comments in my code. Plus i spent on each homework extra time making sure it meets requirements and when i wasn't sure i was double checking forums what's exactly required to do.\n",
      "Ok guys, I am with you on this, had to put it all in one function. But still, I don't think the score is fair as the first issue was correct. \n",
      "Hey, I put offtopic because I don't talk about if its fair or not. It's only for your information.\n",

It's especially true if you look at the reference material: I think I'll lose 20 or whatever points just because of that.Also I see most folks did not implement the handling of a click outside of a modal when it's up and showing. I think that part of implementation is way more important than assigning the ID's...Just a rant. This is \"small stuff\" but I think this is worth fixing in the course for the next \"generations\"...
